GitHub Authentication Methods

Authentication is how GitHub verifies your identity before allowing access to your repositories or letting you perform actions like pushing or pulling code.

Why authentication is needed

GitHub needs to confirm who you are to prevent unauthorized users from changing or accessing your code. This keeps your work secure and ensures only trusted users can make changes.

Personal Access Token (PAT)

A personal access token is a long, secure string that works like a password but is more secure. You generate it from your GitHub account. When using Git over HTTPS, GitHub will ask for your username and password. You enter your GitHub username as usual, but instead of your password, you paste the token. This lets GitHub know it's really you. PATs can also be limited in scope and revoked anytime.

SSH Key

An SSH key is a set of two linked files: a private key stored on your device and a public key uploaded to your GitHub account. When you try to connect to GitHub using SSH, your computer proves your identity using the private key. GitHub checks this against the public key you uploaded. This way, you don't need to enter a password every time. You just use the SSH version of the repository link, and GitHub authenticates you automatically.

When to use each

Use a personal access token when working from shared or new devices, or when using Git over HTTPS. Use an SSH key when working from your own computer and want easier, password-free access. Both methods are secure ways to prove your identity to GitHub and allow you to push, pull, or clone code.
